# Notification System Fixes

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Scrollbar to Notifications Dropdown

**File:** `/components/NotificationsDropdown.tsx`

- Changed `ScrollArea` from `max-h-96` to fixed `h-[400px]` for consistent scrollbar appearance
- This ensures the scrollbar is always visible when there are many notifications
- The 400px height provides enough space for ~4-5 notifications before scrolling is needed

### 2. Immediate Notification Updates

**File:** `/components/NotificationsDropdown.tsx`

- Added `useEffect` hook to immediately update displayed alerts when the `alerts` prop changes
- Created local state `displayedAlerts` that syncs with the parent `alerts` prop
- This ensures notifications appear instantly without delay

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  setDisplayedAlerts(alerts);
}, [alerts]);
```

### 3. Auto-Delete Notifications When Medicine is Deleted

**File:** `/services/dataService.ts` - `deleteMedicine` method

- When a medicine is deleted, all related notifications are automatically removed
- Filters alerts by `medicineId` and removes matching ones from storage

```typescript
// Delete all alerts related to this medicine
const alerts = getAlertsFromStorage();
const filteredAlerts = alerts.filter(alert => alert.medicineId !== medicineId);
saveToStorage(STORAGE_KEYS.ALERTS, filteredAlerts);
```

### 4. Notification Reload on Medicine Changes

**File:** `/App.tsx`

- Added `loadAlerts()` call after medicine is saved (added or updated)
- Ensures alert count updates immediately

**File:** `/components/MedicineList.tsx`

- Added `onMedicineDeleted` callback prop
- Calls parent's `loadAlerts()` when a medicine is deleted
- Added toast notification confirming deletion and notification cleanup

### 5. Auto-Cleanup Old Notifications

**File:** `/services/dataService.ts` - `getAlerts` method

- Automatically removes notifications older than 24 hours when alerts are fetched
- Keeps the notification list clean and relevant

```typescript
const now = new Date();
const oneDayAgo = new Date(now.getTime() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
const recentAlerts = alerts.filter(alert => new Date(alert.createdAt) > oneDayAgo);
```

### 6. Added Out of Stock Icon

**File:** `/components/NotificationsDropdown.tsx`

- Added `PackageX` icon for out-of-stock notifications
- Provides better visual distinction between notification types

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Notifications now have a consistent, scrollable area
2. **Real-time Updates**: Changes are reflected immediately in the notification dropdown
3. **Data Consistency**: Deleting a medicine automatically cleans up related notifications
4. **Auto-Cleanup**: Old notifications are removed after 24 hours
5. **Visual Feedback**: Users get toast confirmations when medicines are deleted

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open notifications dropdown with 5+ notifications - verify scrollbar appears
- [ ] Delete a medicine - verify related notifications disappear immediately
- [ ] Add a medicine - verify notification count updates if needed
- [ ] Check that notifications update without needing to close/reopen the dropdown
- [ ] Verify old notifications (24+ hours) are automatically removed
